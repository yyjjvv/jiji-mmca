                        <p>Ai Weiwei: Defend the Future brings together a selection of works from the oeuvre of Ai
                            Weiwei (1957‒), ranging from painting and photography to film, installation, architecture,
                            public art, curated works, and publications. Born in Beijing, China, in 1957, his parents
                            were the poets Ai Qing, and Gao Ying, and he grew up in Xinjiang, in the western part of
                            China, as his father was forced by the Chinese communist government to work in political
                            exile since the Anti-Rightist Campaign. He came back to Beijing in 1975, after his father
                            was fully rehabilitated. He enrolled in the Beijing Film Academy, majoring in animation, in
                            1978. It was here that he became actively involved in the "Stars" group, one of China's
                            earliest avant-garde art collectives, in 1979. He then went to New York in 1981, where he
                            encountered works by Marcel Duchamp, Andy Warhol, and Jasper Johns, among others, leading
                            him to establish his own perspective on contemporary art. After returning to Beijing in
                            1993, he initiated formation of the Caochangdi Art District in the eastern part of Beijing
                            and served as an artistic consultant for the Beijing National Stadium (often called the
                            "Bird’s Nest"), designed by the Herzog & de Meuron architecture firm, in 2007 prior to the
                            Beijing Olympics.</p>

                        <p>Time of the Earth (2021) is an open platform that surveys the ecological worldview that has
                            emerged as the zeitgeist of the current era, which is characterized by global crises such as
                            climate change and pandemics. In addition to an archive, it presents works by 16 artists
                            based in Korea and overseas who seek to restore the values of "symbiosis," "connection," and
                            "balance." New works by Korean artists Kim Juree, Na Hyun, Beak Jungki, Seo Dongjoo, Jang
                            minseung, Jeong Kyudong, and Chung Soyoung meet works by international artists Olafur
                            Eliasson, Jean-Luc Mylayne, Giuseppe Penone, Christian Boltanski, and Hiroshi Sugimoto to
                            considerately and communally canvass the relationship between humans and nature, pursue
                            balance and harmony, and establish an open consensus on coevolution.</p>

                        <p>Ever since its establishment in 1969, the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art,
                            Korea has acquired artwork through purchases and donations as it works to contribute to
                            defining Korean art history. The recent donation of the Lee Kun-hee Collection brings the
                            scale of the museum's collection to over 10,000 works of art. Fifty-five percent of those
                            were acquired through donations, which have helped to enrich the collection while overcoming
                            the constraints of a limited acquisition budget.</p>

                            not from inside the art world itself, but from a periodic and social perspective, the

                            modern and contemporary art history was organized in cooperation with researchers
                            specializing in each historical period.</p>
